Currently thereÂ´s 3 firmwares and probably some new coming.

0.85 Classic One
0.90 ALT 2023 Type A
0.98 ALT 2023 Type B
xxx and probably more coming...

Everyone has his quirks and different natures. Try them all and please give me feedback on it for me to keep developing it.

0.85 Classic One

CONTROLS

To control it it has 6 potentiometers and 3 buttons. The pots are:

-TEMPO. It controls the tempo/speed. To accept external clock set TEMPO pot at minimun.

-BASE REGISTER. It determines if the machine is more musical or glichy. Better left it around 3 o'clock position for more musical results. Turning it to the center and left side produces more noisy/glitchy and chaotic outputs. You have been prevented!

-INTENSITY. The higher this pot, the more amount of notes and percusions sounding. This is a very playable way of alter the generative composition by transitioning between the simple and complex sound patterns

-SEQUENCE. It let you browse between sequences. Turn it to select random patterns

-DISPERSION. the higher this pot, the most registers that we are writing on the chip, so the sequences get more complex and chaotic. This and intensity are a very playable pair and both are related. Once you tuned something that you like, try to do variations playing this pot and INTENSITY one

-COMBINATION. It multiplex, demultiplex and recombines sequences, keeping the output related but always fresh and different. At minimun it produces a 16 step sequence. At maximun it produces a 8 steps sequence. Between is where the magic happens, and it recombines and produce generative patterns via bitshifting and logic operations of the sequences.

It has 3 buttons, Left, Right and Reset. Reset is located in the arduino and is self explanatory. If you have been playing in the BASE REG pot center/left side and it has turned too chaotic or noisy, just put BASE REG pot around 3 o'clock and press reset. It will come back to more musical landscapes.

Left and Right buttons are to be determined as the firmware is still in development.

It has Clock In and Clock Out so you can synch it with external gear. To accept external clock set TEMPO pot at minimun.

0.90 ALT 2023 Type A

Whats new:

-BASE REG pot doesnt have a glitchy zone. You can pretty much dial now in the whole travel and get nice sounds

-INTENSITY pot now goes way more intense and dramatic that before

-SEQUENCE is totally new. It dampens parts of the operators. At max it does not damp anything. From minimum to 12AM it centers in sub basses zones, from 12 to max, it enhances percussions instruments

DISPERSION, TEMPO and COMBINATION keep working the same

Left button toggles on/off drum parts

Right button toggles on/off high piched instruments

In general, all the ranges have been ampliated, the results are more musical/percussive and pretty much every pot does something good sounding, most of the time!

CONTROLS

To control it it has 6 potentiometers and 3 buttons. The pots are:

-TEMPO. It controls the tempo/speed. To accept external clock set TEMPO pot at minimun.

-BASE REGISTER. Find sweet spots. Turn it slightly for light variations. Turn it fast and violently for dramatic changes.

-INTENSITY. In this firmware center, at 12oclok is intensity point cero. Going to the left or to the right get opposite effects on the operations.

-SEQUENCE. It has been totally revamped. Now it controls the volume of the percussion channels. Also if you press LEFT button, while turning this por you control the probability of the drums to trigger. When you release the button, then you control the volume of the drums again.

-DISPERSION. the higher this pot, the most registers that we are writing on the chip, so the sequences get more complex and chaotic. This and intensity are a very playable pair and both are related. Once you tuned something that you like, try to do variations playing this pot and INTENSITY one. This play mostly in subtle changes, when you want to keep the main musical theme just producing subtle variations.

-COMBINATION. It multiplex, demultiplex and recombines sequences, keeping the output related but always fresh and different. At minimun it produces a 8 step sequence. At maximun it produces a 16 steps sequence. Between is where the magic happens, and it recombines and produce generative patterns via bitshifting and logic operations of the sequences. Now it has the double of resolution that the original firmware, so double of sweet spots and travel

It has 3 buttons, Left, Right and Reset. Reset is located in the arduino and is self explanatory.

Left button changes the drumming as explained in -SEQUENCE and right button produces coherent variations of the ritmhs and melodies

It has Clock In and Clock Out so you can synch it with external gear. To accept external clock set TEMPO pot at minimun.
